This is the most complex part, responsible for higher-order functions. 
We'd need to bundle several powerful models here.


      

What it does: Conscious thought, problem-solving, language, long-term memory, emotional processing, and voluntary motor commands.


      
      
      
Component Models:

Cerebrum (Cortex): This would be a Large Language Model (LLM) like me, or a more advanced multi-modal model. It handles reasoning, language generation, and understanding complex, abstract concepts.

      
Prefrontal Cortex (Decision-Making): A Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent. This model would take goals from the LLM and sensor data from the Midbrain to make high-level decisions and plans.

      
Hippocampus (Memory): A Vector Database. This is our long-term memory. When the LLM "thinks" or "recalls," it queries this database for relevant memories (embeddings) to provide context for its new thoughts.

      
Limbic System (Emotion/Motivation): This could be a state model that assigns "valence" (good/bad) or "arousal" (intensity) to stimuli. This state would influence the RL agent's reward function and the LLM's "tone" or "focus.""")
