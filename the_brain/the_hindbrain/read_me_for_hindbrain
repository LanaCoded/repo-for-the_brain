    The Hindbrain (The "Autonomic & Motor Hub") This is the most primitive part, responsible for keeping the system alive and coordinated. We'd model this with highly reliable, specialized processes.

What it does: Manages all vital autonomic functions (breathing, heart rate), coordinates balance and fine motor movements, and relays signals between the brain and spinal cord.

Component Models:

Cerebellum (Motor Refinement): A PID Controller or Predictive Control Model. This model doesn't decide to move, but it perfects the movement. It receives the "go" command (e.g., "pick up glass") from the Forebrain (RL agent) and sensory feedback from the Midbrain (e.g., "hand is 5cm left of target") and calculates the micro-corrections needed to make the movement smooth, accurate, and coordinated. This is our "procedural memory" for physical tasks.

Brainstem (Pons & Medulla): This would be a set of Background Services or Daemons (in an OS-sense). They are not "smart" learning models but critical, hard-coded feedback loops.

Medulla Oblongata (Vital Functions): A System Monitor & Regulator. This is a while (true) loop checking vital signs. It runs simple, non-negotiable logic: if (CO2_level > threshold) { increase_breathing_rate(); } or if (blood_pressure < low_limit) { constrict_blood_vessels(); }. This ensures the system stays online.

Pons (Relay & State Control): A Message Queue & State Machine. It acts as the primary data bus, routing signals from the Forebrain's "Cortex" (LLM) to the Cerebellum (PID controller) to execute commands. It also manages system-wide states, like a state machine for "sleep," "wake," and "alert" modes, which would throttle or prioritize other processes.
